# Frame by Frame video player
made for myself to play animation reference videos for simple draw-along practice.
#### future features: 
 - toggle normal video playback
 - timeline scrubbing
 - replay

## Currently
-> implementing gui in opengl/glfw
-> looking into filedialog options for selecting mp4 files

## TODO
- [ ] file button should prompt file selection
    - [ ] program should start w/o video and load/play when selected through ui button
- [ ] opengl text sheet / display text on button (start w/ file select button)
- [ ] the structure of the program is getting spagetti'ed...yikes
- [ ] skip and hold frame < [ 10 ] > UI elements 
- [ ] decide: only adjust while paused or change to do while playing? (callbacks/recalc needed)
